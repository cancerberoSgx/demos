Hello Anthony, 

I wonder where are the sources of documentation at http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/ and https://www.imagemagick.org/script/examples.php. Particularly I'm interested on accessing all scripts like http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/advanced/create_bullet or https://www.imagemagick.org/source/examples.pl. I think these are a great getting started documentation and I would like to have access to a repository maintaining these. 

One reason is because some of them are not working correctly, (perhaps because incompatibilities with new ImageMagick versions ?)
, for example stars bursts example at https://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/advanced/#stars

Aparently this documentation at http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/ is not published in any repo at https://github.com/ImageMagick

Also to tell you I'm using Imagemagick in the browser thanks to https://github.com/KnicKnic/WASM-ImageMagick, some exapmles: 

 * https://codesandbox.io/s/lp7lxz6l59
 * https://cancerberosgx.github.io/autumn-leaves/#/
 * https://cancerberosgx.github.io/demos/WASM-ImageMagick/interactive-execute-context/

Perhaps is a good idea to anounce this port in the documentation so people is more aware of this project ? 

Thanks ! and congrats again ! I'm using image magick for 10 years now and I found it always awesome! (although I'm not an expert, yet!) thanks again
