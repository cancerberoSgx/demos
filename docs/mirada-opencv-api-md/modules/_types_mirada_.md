User provided image formats encode/decode implementation. The proxy is responsible of creating codec
instances

 This is particularly useful in this library so it can actually contain the implementation of concrete
 Codecs (see [JimpCodec]) without actually being responsible of loading / instantiating the library which
 will have to be handled by a JimpProxy provided by a third party (test, playground/user) . In other words,
 mirada provides codecs implementations for several libraries and at the while keeping agnostic/independent

 This is probably called only once and after obtaining a codec the same instance is used by the manager.
